# Plant disease detection with CNNs: effects of real-time data augmentation and hyperparameters

 Final project of the "Vision and Cognitive Services" course at University of Padua during 2020/2021.

### Description

The goal is to exploit deep-learning techniques in order to detect plant disease and pest.
in an autonomous way.

### Content

Making use of the "PlantVIllage Dataset", most famous deep network has been implemented such as *VGG16*, *VGG19*, *ResNet* , *Inception* and the results has been compared and analized.

In the end, through some optimization methods, we obtained impressive result both with Convulutional Neural network (**CNN**) and Residual network (**ResNet**)
